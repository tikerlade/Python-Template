# Python :snake: template project
This project have everything I need to start a Python project :pencil:.

This includes but not limits: linters, tests + coverage, .gitignore, CI setting up. Below you can see instructions what you need to configure for your personal application + full list of technologies pre-configured with links :link:.

## Instructions :bookmark_tabs:
_If you are on a Unix system you can run `./setup.sh` to skip all next steps._

- `pip install -r requirements.txt` (this will download all important libraries)
- `pre-commit intall` (this will enable pre-commit checks)

## GitHub repository setup
Comming soon


## Structure
- `app/` - contains full code to deploy to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
- `python-template/` - main part of your Python code should be placed here
- `.gitignore` - files and folders that won't be tracked by git
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - file with checks that pre-commit needs to run
- `README.md` - this file with explanations
- `requirements.txt` - file with Python requirements for proper work
- `setup.cfg` - configuration of tools which will be used in pre-commit and other tools installed from requirements.txt
